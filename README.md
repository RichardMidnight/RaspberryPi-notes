# Desktop environments

## Install standard Linux Desktop Environments.  watch out - unstable! seems to break wifi and other things
             
Install other desktop environments: 

      sudo tasksel
      
Switch to a different desktop environment:
      
      sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager

For a Windows-like experience:

      Install the "KDE/Plasma DE"
      For even more: you can install a windows theme with "global theme"
      
 ## Other options

Raspberry pi 5 boot nvme

      Make sure your Raspberry Pi 5 firmware is up to date with the 2023-12-06 or later version. Software update on the RPi OS should do this for you, but you can force it by running sudo rpi-eeprom-update in the Terminal. 

      If you have updated your firmware and want to boot from the NVMe drive, you might have to get technical and run 
      
      sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit 
      
      from the Terminal and change the BOOT_ORDER to be 0x416 instead of 0x41.

      To enable experimental and not-officially-supported PCIe 3 mode, add the follow line to the [all] section at the end of your Raspberry Pi /boot/config.txt file like this:

      [all]
      dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
      
      Save and reboot - your drive is ready to use!
